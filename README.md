Hello! My name is Miro, and I'm on an exciting journey to become a proficient web developer. I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, as well as good knowledge in Linux operating system and I'm continuously expanding my skills and knowledge. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and learning new technologies.

Skills: Node.js / React / JS / HTML / CSS /

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://github.com/Miro-wq/goit-js-hw-07 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more in depth JavaScript 
- âš¡ Fun fact:  It took less code to send a man to the Moon than to run a smartphone.
